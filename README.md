Hey guys, so full_code.py is essentially a copy from the tutorial https://www.anishathalye.com/2017/07/25/synthesizing-adversarial-examples/

The other source code files is just a modularization of that code (plus or minus some parts).

Just make sure that the code actually runs and you understand it at least to some degree.
